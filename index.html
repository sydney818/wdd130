            <p>Hello! My name is Sydney Anderson, I was born and raised in Utah. With four young kids, 
                    our household is always bustling. Recently, we moved out of the city to embrace a bit of 
                    country life, and it's been fantastic! I've always dreamed of having horses and learning 
                    to ride. I'm excited that we now have two horses, and I'm excited to start a new adventure!
