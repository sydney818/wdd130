            <p>Hello! My name is Sydney Anderson, I was born and raised in Utah. With four young kids, our home is always bustling. I grew up in Salt Lake City, we recently, 
                we moved out of the city to embrace a bit of country life, and it's been amazing! I've always been a big animal lover; (I'd probably have a farm if my husband
                would let me). Currently, we have three dogs, five chickens, and we've just welcomed two horses. Owning a horse and learning to ride has been a lifelong dream 
                of mine, and I'm thrilled for our new adventures.
            </p>
